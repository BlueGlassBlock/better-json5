# CHANGELOG

- Fixed schema cache and real-time updates for file-referencing schemas.

## 1.5.0

- Fixed syntax highlighting for comments in objects.
- Added `json5.format.startIgnoreDirective` and `json5.format.endIgnoreDirective` settings to control the start and end of ignore directives in formatting. Currently they only work for `//` line comments.([#12](https://github.com/BlueGlassBlock/better-json5/issues/12))
- Fixed trailing comma formatting for objects having comments as their last token.
- Added `json5.format.tabSize` to override tab size for formatting. If set to `false`, it will use the default tab size of the editor. ([#14](https://github.com/BlueGlassBlock/better-json5/issues/14))
- Added Chinese translation for the extension.
- Changed default sorting order: symbols -> uncapitalized keys -> capitalized keys.

## 1.4.0

- Colorization for numerics now can be selected with `numbers` in `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` settings. ([#11](https://github.com/BlueGlassBlock/better-json5/issues/11))
- TextMate scopes for numerics are now `constant.numeric.hex.json5` and `constant.numeric.dec.json5` for hexadecimal and decimal numbers respectively.



## 1.3.0

- Suggestions now respect quote of current input, instead of forcing users to use `json5.format.keyQuotes` and `json5.format.stringQuotes` settings all the time. ([#9](https://github.com/BlueGlassBlock/better-json5/issues/9))

## 1.2.1

- Fixed a minor issue that caused keys with only one character to be flagged as false-positive.

## 1.2.0

- Removed telemetry code that came with the fork.

- Addressed [vscode#232647](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/232647).

- Supported `${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolderBasename}`, `${pathSeparator}`, `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` and `${config:CONFIG_NAME}` in `fileMatch` and `url` properties of `json5.schema` settings. ([#4](https://github.com/BlueGlassBlock/better-json5/issues/4))

> Please note that using variable substitution in `fileMatch` may not work as you expected since the pattern is identified as a **glob pattern**, and it doesn't like path separators that may come with variables.
